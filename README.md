 ### Here is a detailed summary of my journey before the data course with Just IT

My name is Freddie Sherwood, and I am from Derby, in my secondary school years I took a mock GCSE exam in Computer science/It exam, I received a grade 5 on the written and the assessment and code, for my GCSEâ€™s I received a Grade 4 in Maths and English(language) a grade 5 in Design and Science, I also received  a grade 4 in Music and Art, I  didnâ€™t decide to progress further at that time but now I find myself with an interest in It specifically Data Tech. 

I have a passion for the Data Analyst role as I have an interest in working with Data as I really enjoy problem solving and improving efficiency in scenarios as well as extracting Data from sources and compiling it into interactive reports for analysis, Iâ€™ve found myself applied for the Data Analyst Course with Just IT as it had caught my attention and has helped me get further into the desired area of work. 

Iâ€™ve worked various jobs in the warehouse sector building up teamwork and communication skills, Iâ€™ve decided to move into Data with interest of securing a job as Iâ€™ve always liked solving problems, improving efficiency in day-to-day work as well as adaptability which link well with the role of a Data Analyst with the soft skills I already have such as pattern recognition, innovative skills and critical thinking, I have more of my skills listed on my cv, Iâ€™ve decided to join a Data Technician bootcamp to help me develop my hard skills within the world of Data in hand-to-hand management with Data and  the processes of edifying, altering and presenting Data,  

Fun fact about me, I really enjoy Design and problem solving with report building with the presentation of Data as well as Art and Music.
