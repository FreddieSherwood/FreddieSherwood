I have a passion for the Data Analyst role as I have an interest in working with Data as I really enjoy problem solving and improving efficiency in scenarios as well as extracting Data from sources and compiling it into interactive reports for analysis, wanting to change the area and field I worked in from the warehouse sector, Iâ€™ve found myself applied for the Data Analyst Course with Just IT as it had caught my attention and has helped me get further into the desired area of work in Data Tech. 

Iâ€™ve worked various jobs in the warehouse sector building up teamwork and communication skills, Iâ€™ve decided to move into Data with interest of securing a job as Iâ€™ve always liked solving problems, improving efficiency in day-to-day work as well as adaptability which link well with the role of a Data Analyst with the soft skills I already have such as pattern recognition, innovative skills and critical thinking, I have more of my skills listed on my cv, Iâ€™ve decided to join a Data Technician bootcamp to help me develop my hard skills within the world of Data in hand-to-hand management with Data and  the processes of edifying, altering and presenting Data.  

Fun fact about me, I really enjoy Design and problem solving with report building with the presentation of Data as well as Art and Music.
